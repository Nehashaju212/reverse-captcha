Project Description

Our Advanced Reverse Captcha is a fun, web-based challenge where users must "prove they're a robot" by selecting all images of specific categories. A twist on traditional Captchas, this one makes you select animals, or anything else a "robot" would know.


The Problem (that doesn't exist)

Too many Captchas are focused on weeding out bots. But what if we wanted to make bots feel welcome? Who's solving the problem of leaving robots out of the human experience? No one… until now.


The Solution (that nobody asked for)

With the Reverse Captcha, we're inviting robots to step up and prove their worth. Select images of animals or follow other quirky instructions, and prove you're a true bot among bots.
